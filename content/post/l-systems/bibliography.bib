  abstract = {{Functional–structural plant models (FSPM) constitute a paradigm in plant modelling that combines 3D structural and graphical modelling with the simulation of plant processes. While structural aspects of plant development could so far be represented using rule-based formalisms such as Lindenmayer systems, process models were traditionally written using a procedural code. The faithful representation of structures interacting with functions across scales, however, requires a new modelling formalism. Therefore relational growth grammars (RGG) were developed on the basis of Lindenmayer systems.In order to implement and test RGG, a new modelling language, the eXtended L-system language (XL) was created. Models using XL are interpreted by the interactive, Java-based modelling platform GroIMP. Three models, a semi-quantitative gibberellic acid (GA) signal transduction model, and a phytochrome-based shade detection and object avoidance model, both coupled to an existing morphogenetic structural model of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), serve as examples to demonstrate the versatility and suitability of RGG and XL to represent the interaction of diverse biological processes across hierarchical scales.The dynamics of the concentrations in the signal transduction network could be modelled qualitatively and the phenotypes of GA-response mutants faithfully reproduced. The light model used here was simple to use yet effective enough to carry out local measurement of red:far-red ratios. Suppression of tillering at low red:far-red ratios could be simulated.The RGG formalism is suitable for implementation of multi-scaled FSPM of plants interacting with their environment via hormonal control. However, their ensuing complexity requires careful design. On the positive side, such an FSPM displays knowledge gaps better thereby guiding future experimental design.}},

  abstract = {This paper presents a spatial simulation model of above-ground morphogenesis in a gramineous crop, grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Functions and parameters describing structural development were obtained from three-dimensional (3D) measurements of plants made at intervals during their development. The functions were expressed as specifications of morphogenesis in the L-system formalism and the specifications were interpreted by specialised software to create 3D virtual sorghum plants. Using the length and height of the collar of an early leaf as initial states, realistic images were generated of the lengths and shapes of subsequent leaves. The approach captures the dynamic interaction between partitioning and morphogenesis and presents the complex results as images that aid rapid interpretation.}

               L systems were originated by Aristid Lindenmayer in connection with biological considerations in 1968. The theory of L systems has a great impact on formal language theory. Two main features of the theory of L systems are parallelism in the rewriting process and the notion of a grammar conceived as a description of a dynamic process, rather than of a static one. L systems have enriched the theory of formal languages and also been able to put the theory in a totally new perspective. This chapter discusses the mathematical theory of L systems. One of the outstanding features of the theory of L systems is that its core fits into a systematic and basic mathematical framework formed by single or several iterated homomorphisms or finite substitutions on a free monoid. The chapter discusses this systematic framework. The basic construct of L systems theory is the daily oral language (DOL) system. A DOL system represents a basic mathematical structure—the iteration of a single homomorphism on a free monoid. Although mathematically most simple, DOL systems give a clear insight into the essential ideas and techniques behind L systems and parallel rewriting in general.}
