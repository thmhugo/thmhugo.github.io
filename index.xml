Introduction $$\textit{&amp;quot; Graphs are nice [&amp;hellip;], but sparse graphs are nicer. &amp;ldquo;}$$
Graphs are a very common data structure in many areas of computer science, such as optimization and networks.</description></item><item><title>L-systems - Computer Graphics assignment @ Sorbonne Université</title><link>https://thmhugo.github.io/post/l-systems/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thmhugo.github.io/post/l-systems/</guid><description>Foreword: In this short report, I will make a quick review of L-systems, relying on the book The algorithmic beauty of plants [@TheAB], without talking about the code implementation. The theoretical tools have not changed since the release of the book, it fully covers the state-of-the-art. I will simply explain part of its content. Finally, I have carefully chosen to explain only the parts that are the most interesting to me.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://thmhugo.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thmhugo.github.io/about/</guid><description>Quantum information student as Sorbonne université
